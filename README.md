# Malaria-Cell-Identifier-using-CNN
The project deals with using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Keras to identify Malaria Cell images.
The data is taken from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria

### Get the dataset
1. Download the dataset from the website: https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria
2. Extract the `.zip` file and a folder will appear `cell_images`
3. Copy the folder `cell_images` to the directory where the project is located (the folder `Malaria-Cell-Identifier-using-CNN`) as described below 

### Usage (With virtualenv environment)
1. Clone the repository to your machine when inside a given directory
```
git clone https://github.com/kb22/Malaria-Cell-Identifier-using-CNN.git
```
2. Create a virtual environment
```
virtualenv -p python3 Malaria-Cell-Identifier-using-CNN
```
3. Go inside the folder `Malaria-Cell-Identifier-using-CNN`
```
cd Malaria-Cell-Identifier-using-CNN
```
4. Activate the environment
```
source bin/activate
```
5. Install all dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
6. Run the notebook
```
